- Embedding **Power BI visuals** for dynamic reporting  

## 🎯 Business Use Cases  
- Identify **peak demand hours** and optimize driver allocation  
- Analyze **customer behavior** for personalized marketing strategies  
- Understand **pricing and surge patterns**  
- Detect anomalies or potential **fraudulent activities**  
- Track **ride cancellations** and reasons for operational improvements  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** – Data processing & EDA  
- **Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib** – Data visualization  
- **SQLite3** – Database storage & queries  
- **Streamlit** – Interactive dashboard  
- **Power BI (optional)** – Advanced visualization  # Ola-ride-analysis--SQL-and-PowerBI
